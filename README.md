# baccarat

## Purpose
For a living, I've worked as an online baccarat dealer in Canada since this winter. I'm Korean, where it is illegal to play gambling, so this is a new experience for me. I never imagined that I would get this kind of job before, so it made me curious. With a countless number of games, I felt I could expect the highest capability. That's why I started this project.

## winning rate
In baccarat, the probability of winning by position is as follows:

- The Banker's hand has the highest probability of winning at 45.86% in a traditional eight-deck game[1][5].
- The Player's hand has a slightly lower probability of winning at 44.62%[3][4].
- Ties win 9.6% of the time[3].

When factoring out the tie, the Banker's hand wins about 51 percent of the time, giving it a slight advantage over the Player's hand[3]. The house edge for the Banker's hand is 1.06%, while the house edge for the Player's hand is 1.24%[3]. These probabilities and house edges make baccarat a game of chance with relatively low house advantages compared to other casino games.
